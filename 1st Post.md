#What No one Tells You About Moringa School

Where on earth can you do all the things Computer Scientists take 4 years to study in only 4 months?
With my curiosity, on January the 11th, i started my journey in this prestigious school. To find out how this was possible and how could one complete such enormous tasks in a very short span of time. I decided and settled on the best way. To go through the experience. Not the stories i was being told about the school. Am barely two weeks old but for me i feel like it has been an eternity of learning. Every second i have been on toes. Every minute is an opportunity to sharpen my programming skills. Everyday am becoming the better programmer. Every week seems like a day in my schedule. This why today i will share with you what no one tells you about Moringa School.

>>1.It only happens at Moringa School where the official class starts at 8.00 am but students arrive at 6.00 am. 
>>2. It is only in Moringa that if you fail to mention the name commits and push then you are very normal and sane thus it's not a place for you.
>>3. It is only in Moringa that students are given a moment off to go for a walk or even lunch only for the tutors to come back and find all the students in the same position they had left them.
>>4. It only happens in Moringa where every second is a thinking and coding opportunity.
>>5. It is only in Moringa where the white board is deleted and not erased.
>>6. It only happens in Moringa where if new you won't notice a difference between a tutor and a student.
>>7. It only happens in Moringa where sudents stay in class even when there is no tutor around.
>>8.It is only in Moringa where students leave class for home at 10.00 pm.
>>9. It is only in Moringa where one could do things that seems impossible in real life.
>>10. It is only in Moringa where YOU belong.
